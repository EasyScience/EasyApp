# EasyApp


Application skeleton with eye-catching and intuitive graphical interface for the [EasyScience](http://github.com/EasyScience) framework. Quickly build all-in-one cross-platform applications using the provided collection of Qt QML components, Python tools, and by binding with the [EasyScience](http://github.com/EasyScience/EasyScience) Python backend.

Current success stories are for the fields of powder neutron diffraction ([EasyDiffraction](http://github.com/EasyScience/EasyDiffraction)) and reflectometry ([EasyReflectometry](http://github.com/EasyScience/EasyReflectometry)), where user defined models are used for simulations and can be refined against experimental data.
